# Welcome to Ghana API

GhanaAPI is the definitive REST API for Ghanaian services. It unifies data that is otherwise scattered across government portals, financial sources, and local datasets into one reliable, developer-friendly platform.

## 🌟 Core Services

- **🎓 Education Data** – National directory of universities, colleges, SHS, JHS, and TVET institutions with regional filters, grading, and program metadata
- **🏠 Address & Location Services** – Ghana Post Digital Address validation (coming soon), geocoding, reverse geocoding, and location lookup
- **🏦 Banking & ATM Locator** – Searchable directory of bank branches and ATMs with proximity search, branch metadata, and OSM enrichment
- **📈 Stock Market Data** – Real-time Ghana Stock Exchange pricing, market summaries, sector performance, and company profiles
- **💱 Exchange Rates** – Live GHS exchange rates, currency conversion, historical data tracking, and provider fallbacks
- **🚗 Transport & Logistics** – Route planning, transport stops, fuel prices, travel cost estimation, and multi-provider routing fallbacks
- **🗺️ Location Data** – Complete Ghanaian administrative hierarchy with regions, districts, and metadata

Each service follows the same conventions: versioned endpoints under `/api/v1`, consistent response shapes, and comprehensive Swagger documentation.
