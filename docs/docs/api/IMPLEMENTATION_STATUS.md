## 🔧 Backend Implementation Details

### Address Services

#### ✅ Implemented Endpoints

- `GET /addresses/search` - Search addresses by keyword
- `GET /addresses/lookup` - Reverse geocoding from coordinates

#### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

- `GET /addresses/validate/:code` - Address validation
  - Backend endpoint exists but throws "Address validation not yet implemented" error
  - Documentation marked as "Coming Soon"
- `POST /addresses/standardize` - Address standardization
  - Backend endpoint exists but throws "Address standardization not yet implemented" error
  - Documentation marked as "Coming Soon"

### Exchange Rates

#### ✅ Implemented Endpoints

- `GET /exchange-rates/current` - Get current exchange rates
- `POST /exchange-rates/convert` - Convert currency amounts

### Crypto

#### ✅ Implemented Endpoints

- `GET /crypto` - Get cryptocurrency prices in USD and GHS
  - Supports comma-separated `ids` query parameter
  - Uses CoinGecko as the primary upstream provider
  - Caches responses for 60 seconds
  - Falls back to simulated pricing data if upstream requests fail
  - Uses exchange-rates service for USD to GHS conversion

#### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

- `GET /exchange-rates/historical` - Historical exchange rates
  - Backend endpoint exists but throws "Historical exchange rates not yet implemented" error
  - Documentation marked as "Coming Soon"
- `GET /exchange-rates/:currency/trend` - Currency trend analysis
  - Backend endpoint exists but throws "Currency trend analysis not yet implemented" error
  - Documentation marked as "Coming Soon"

### Location Data

#### ✅ Implemented Endpoints

- `GET /locations/regions` - Get all regions
- `GET /locations/districts/:regionId` - Get districts for a region

## 📝 Documentation Status

### ✅ Fully Documented

- All endpoints have comprehensive documentation
- Request/response examples provided
- Error handling documented
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Implementation status clearly indicated

### ⏳ Status Indicators Added

- "Coming Soon" badges for unimplemented features
- Clear status messages in documentation
- Implementation status table in overview
- Backend error messages for unimplemented endpoints

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Features (✅ Complete)

- Address search and reverse geocoding
- Crypto price lookup with GHS conversion
- Current exchange rates and conversion
- Regional and district data

### Phase 2: Validation & Standardization (⏳ In Progress)

- Address validation implementation
- Address standardization implementation
- Enhanced error handling

### Phase 3: Historical Data (📋 Planned)

- Historical exchange rates
- Trend analysis
- Data visualization endpoints

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (📋 Planned)

- Batch processing
- Rate limiting
- Advanced analytics

## 🔍 Testing Status

### ✅ Tested Endpoints

- All implemented endpoints have unit tests
- Integration tests for core functionality
- Error handling tests
- Crypto controller and service test coverage

### ⏳ Testing Needed

- Tests for unimplemented endpoints (when implemented)
- Performance testing
- Load testing

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Implement Address Validation**

   - Add validation logic to `AddressesService.validateDigitalCode()`
   - Update controller to return proper responses
   - Add comprehensive tests

2. **Implement Address Standardization**

   - Add standardization logic to `AddressesService.standardizeAddress()`
   - Update controller to return proper responses
   - Add comprehensive tests

3. **Implement Historical Exchange Rates**

   - Add historical data storage
   - Implement data retrieval logic
   - Add date range validation

4. **Implement Currency Trends**
   - Add trend calculation algorithms
   - Implement data aggregation
   - Add visualization endpoints

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Unimplemented Endpoints Return Errors**

   - This is intentional to prevent confusion
   - Clear error messages indicate implementation status
   - Documentation clearly marks these as "Coming Soon"

2. **Limited Currency Support**
   - Currently supports only 4 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, NGN)
   - Additional currencies planned for future releases
