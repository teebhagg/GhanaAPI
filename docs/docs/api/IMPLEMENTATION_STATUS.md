- Load testing

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Implement Address Validation**

   - Add validation logic to `AddressesService.validateDigitalCode()`
   - Update controller to return proper responses
   - Add comprehensive tests

2. **Implement Address Standardization**

   - Add standardization logic to `AddressesService.standardizeAddress()`
   - Update controller to return proper responses
   - Add comprehensive tests

3. **Implement Historical Exchange Rates**

   - Add historical data storage
   - Implement data retrieval logic
   - Add date range validation

4. **Implement Currency Trends**
   - Add trend calculation algorithms
   - Implement data aggregation
   - Add visualization endpoints

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Unimplemented Endpoints Return Errors**

   - This is intentional to prevent confusion
   - Clear error messages indicate implementation status
   - Documentation clearly marks these as "Coming Soon"

2. **Limited Currency Support**
   - Currently supports only 4 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, NGN)
   - Additional currencies planned for future releases
